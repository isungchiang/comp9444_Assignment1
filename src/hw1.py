"""
All tensorflow objects, if not otherwise specified, should be explicity
created with tf.float32 datatypes. Not specifying this datatype for variables and
placeholders will cause your code to fail some tests.

For the specified functionality in this assignment, there are generally high
level Tensorflow library calls that can be used. As we are assessing tensorflow,
functionality that is technically correct but implemented manually, using a
library such as numpy, will fail tests. If you find yourself writing 50+ line
methods, it may be a good idea to look for a simpler solution.

Along with the provided functional prototypes, there is another file,
"train.py" which calls the functions listed in this file. It trains the
specified network on the MNIST dataset, and then optimizes the loss using a
standard gradient decent optimizer. You can run this code to check the models
you create.
